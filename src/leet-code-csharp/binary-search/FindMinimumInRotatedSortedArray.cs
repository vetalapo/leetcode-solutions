 * Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
 * 
 * Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times.
 * For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
 *   [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
 *   [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
 *   
 * Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time 
 *        results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
 * 
 * Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
 * 
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
