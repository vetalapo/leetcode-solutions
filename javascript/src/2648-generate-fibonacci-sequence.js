 * Generate Fibonacci Sequence
 **
 * Write a generator function
 * that returns a generator object which yields the fibonacci sequence.
 *
 * The fibonacci sequence is defined by the relation Xn = Xn-1 + Xn-2.
 * The first few numbers of the series are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: callCount = 5
 *   Output: [0,1,1,2,3]
 *   Explanation:
 *     const gen = fibGenerator();
 *     gen.next().value; // 0
 *     gen.next().value; // 1
 *     gen.next().value; // 1
 *     gen.next().value; // 2
 *     gen.next().value; // 3
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: callCount = 0
 *   Output: []
 *   Explanation: gen.next() is never called so nothing is outputted
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 0 <= callCount <= 50
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Javascript has the concept of generators.
 *   They are critical to this problem.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   First yield 0 and 1.
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   Create an infinite "while(true)" loop.
 *
 * Hint 4:
 *   In that loop,
 *   continuously yield the next value which is the sum of the previous two.
