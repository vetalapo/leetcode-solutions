 * Minimum Operations to Equalize Array
 **
 * You are given an integer array nums of length n.
 * In one operation,
 * choose any subarray
 * nums[l...r] (0 <= l <= r < n)
 * and replace each element in that subarray
 * with the bitwise AND of all elements.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of operations
 * required to make all elements of nums equal.
 *
 * A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence
 * of elements within an array.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: nums = [1,2]
 *   Output: 1
 *   Explanation:
 *     Choose nums[0...1]:
 *       (1 AND 2) = 0,
 *       so the array becomes
 *       [0, 0]
 *       and all elements are equal in 1 operation.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: nums = [5,5,5]
 *   Output: 0
 *   Explanation:
 *     nums is [5, 5, 5]
 *     which already has all elements equal,
 *     so 0 operations are required.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= n == nums.length <= 100
 *   • 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   If all elements of nums are already equal,
 *   how many operations are needed?
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   The answer is either 0 or 1.
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   The answer is 0 if all values in the array are initially equal,
 *   and 1 otherwise,
 *   since you can apply the AND operation on the whole array in one step.
