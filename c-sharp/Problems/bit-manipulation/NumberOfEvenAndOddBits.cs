/**
 * 2595
 * Number of Even and Odd Bits
 **
 * You are given a positive integer n.
 * Let even denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of n with value 1.
 * Let odd denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of n with value 1.
 * Note that bits are indexed from right to left in the binary representation of a number.
 *
 * Return the array [even, odd].
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: n = 50
 *   Output: [1,2]
 *   Explanation:
 *     The binary representation of 50 is 110010.
 *     It contains 1 on indices 1, 4, and 5.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: n = 2
 *   Output: [0,1]
 *   Explanation:
 *     The binary representation of 2 is 10.
 *     It contains 1 only on index 1.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= n <= 1000
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Maintain two integer variables, even and odd,
 *   to count the number of even and odd indices
 *   in the binary representation of integer n.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Divide n by 2 while n is positive,
 *   and if n modulo 2 is 1,
 *   add 1 to its corresponding variable.
