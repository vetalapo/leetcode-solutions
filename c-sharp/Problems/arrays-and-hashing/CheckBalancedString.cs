 * Check Balanced String
 **
 * You are given a string num consisting of only digits.
 * A string of digits is called balanced
 * if the sum of the digits at even indices
 * is equal to the sum of digits at odd indices.
 *
 * Return true if num is balanced, otherwise return false.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: num = "1234"
 *   Output: false
 *   Explanation:
 *     The sum of digits at even indices is 1 + 3 == 4,
 *     and the sum of digits at odd indices is 2 + 4 == 6.
 *     Since 4 is not equal to 6,
 *     num is not balanced.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: num = "24123"
 *   Output: true
 *   Explanation:
 *     The sum of digits at even indices is 2 + 1 + 3 == 6,
 *     and the sum of digits at odd indices is 4 + 2 == 6.
 *     Since both are equal
 *     the num is balanced.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 2 <= num.length <= 100
 *   • num consists of digits only
