/**
 * 3798
 * Largest Even Number
 **
 * You are given a string s consisting only of the characters '1' and '2'.
 * You may delete any number of characters from s
 * without changing the order of the remaining characters.
 * Return the largest possible resultant string
 * that represents an even integer.
 * If there is no such string, return the empty string "".
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: s = "1112"
 *   Output: "1112"
 *   Explanation:
 *     The string already represents the largest possible even number,
 *     so no deletions are needed.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: s = "221"
 *   Output: "22"
 *   Explanation:
 *     Deleting '1' results in the largest possible even number
 *     which is equal to 22.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: s = "1"
 *   Output: ""
 *   Explanation:
 *     There is no way to get an even number.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= s.length <= 100
 *   • s consists only of the characters '1' and '2'.
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   A number ending with '1' is odd.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Find the last '2' in s. If none, return "".
 *   Otherwise return the prefix up to and including that '2'.
