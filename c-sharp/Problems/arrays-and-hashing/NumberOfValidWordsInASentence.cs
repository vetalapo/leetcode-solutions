 * Number of Valid Words in a Sentence
 **
 * A sentence consists of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z'),
 * digits ('0' to '9'), hyphens ('-'), punctuation marks ('!', '.', and ','),
 * and spaces (' ') only.
 * Each sentence can be broken down into one or more tokens
 * separated by one or more spaces ' '.
 *
 * A token is a valid word if all three of the following are true:
 *   • It only contains lowercase letters, hyphens,
 *     and/or punctuation (no digits).
 *   • There is at most one hyphen '-'.
 *     If present, it must be surrounded by lowercase characters
 *     ("a-b" is valid, but "-ab" and "ab-" are not valid).
 *   • There is at most one punctuation mark.
 *     If present, it must be at the end of the token
 *     ("ab,", "cd!", and "." are valid, but "a!b" and "c.," are not valid).
 *
 * Examples of valid words include "a-b.", "afad", "ba-c", "a!", and "!".
 *
 * Given a string sentence,
 * return the number of valid words in sentence.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: sentence = "cat and  dog"
 *   Output: 3
 *   Explanation:
 *     The valid words in the sentence are "cat", "and", and "dog".
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: sentence = "!this  1-s b8d!"
 *   Output: 0
 *   Explanation:
 *     There are no valid words in the sentence.
 *     "!this" is invalid because it starts with a punctuation mark.
 *     "1-s" and "b8d" are invalid because they contain digits.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: sentence = "alice and  bob are playing stone-game10"
 *   Output: 5
 *   Explanation:
 *     The valid words in the sentence are
 *     "alice", "and", "bob", "are", and "playing".
 *     "stone-game10" is invalid because it contains digits.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= sentence.length <= 1000
 *   • sentence only contains lowercase English letters,
 *     digits, ' ', '-', '!', '.', and ','.
 *   • There will be at least 1 token.
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Iterate through the string to split it by spaces.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Count the number of characters of each type
 *   (letters, numbers, hyphens, and punctuations).
