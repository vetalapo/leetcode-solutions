 * First Letter to Appear Twice
 **
 * Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear twice.
 * Note:
 *   • A letter a appears twice before another letter b if the second occurrence of a is before the second occurrence of b.
 *   • s will contain at least one letter that appears twice.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: s = "abccbaacz"
 *   Output: "c"
 *   Explanation:
 *     • The letter 'a' appears on the indexes 0, 5 and 6.
 *     • The letter 'b' appears on the indexes 1 and 4.
 *     • The letter 'c' appears on the indexes 2, 3 and 7.
 *     • The letter 'z' appears on the index 8.
 *     • The letter 'c' is the first letter to appear twice, because out of all the letters the index of its second occurrence is the smallest.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: s = "abcdd"
 *   Output: "d"
 *   Explanation: The only letter that appears twice is 'd' so we return 'd'.
 *  
 * 
 * Constraints:
 *   • 2 <= s.length <= 100
 *   • s consists of lowercase English letters.
 *   • s has at least one repeated letter.
 * 
 * Hint 1: Iterate through the string from left to right.
 *         Keep track of the elements you have already seen in a set.
 * 
 * Hint 2: If the current element is already in the set, return that element.
