 * Find Missing Elements
 **
 * You are given an integer array nums consisting of unique integers.
 *
 * Originally, nums contained every integer within a certain range.
 * However, some integers might have gone missing from the array.
 *
 * The smallest and largest integers of the original range
 * are still present in nums.
 *
 * Return a sorted list of all the missing integers in this range.
 * If no integers are missing, return an empty list.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: nums = [1,4,2,5]
 *   Output: [3]
 *   Explanation:
 *     The smallest integer is 1 and the largest is 5,
 *     so the full range should be [1,2,3,4,5].
 *     Among these, only 3 is missing.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: nums = [7,8,6,9]
 *   Output: []
 *   Explanation:
 *     The smallest integer is 6 and the largest is 9,
 *     so the full range is [6,7,8,9].
 *     All integers are already present,
 *     so no integer is missing.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: nums = [5,1]
 *   Output: [2,3,4]
 *   Explanation:
 *     The smallest integer is 1 and the largest is 5,
 *     so the full range should be [1,2,3,4,5].
 *     The missing integers are 2, 3, and 4.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 2 <= nums.length <= 100
 *   • 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   First, find the maximum and minimum elements in the array.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Then, iterate over all the integers in the range [min, max]
 *   and check if they are in the array.
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   If not, add them to the array,
 *   and return the sorted array at the end.
