 * Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters
 **
 * You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.
 * A string is good
 * if it can be formed by characters from chars
 * (each character can only be used once for each word in words).
 *
 * Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
 *   Output: 6
 *   Explanation:
 *     The strings that can be formed are
 *     "cat" and "hat"
 *     so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
 *   Output: 10
 *   Explanation:
 *     The strings that can be formed are
 *     "hello" and "world"
 *     so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= words.length <= 1000
 *   • 1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100
 *   • words[i] and chars consist of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Solve the problem for each string in words independently.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Now try to think in frequency of letters.
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   Count how many times each character occurs in string chars.
 *
 * Hint 4:
 *   To form a string using characters from chars, the frequency of each character in chars must be greater than or equal the frequency of that character in the string to be formed.
