/**
 * 3750
 * Minimum Number of Flips to Reverse Binary String
 **
 * You are given a positive integer n.
 * Let s be the binary representation of n without leading zeros.
 * The reverse of a binary string s
 * is obtained by writing the characters of s in the opposite order.
 * You may flip any bit in s (change 0 → 1 or 1 → 0).
 * Each flip affects exactly one bit.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of flips required to make s equal
 * to the reverse of its original form.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: n = 7
 *   Output: 0
 *   Explanation:
 *     The binary representation of 7 is "111".
 *     Its reverse is also "111", which is the same.
 *     Hence, no flips are needed.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: n = 10
 *   Output: 4
 *   Explanation:
 *     The binary representation of 10 is "1010".
 *     Its reverse is "0101".
 *     All four bits must be flipped to make them equal.
 *     Thus, the minimum number of flips required is 4.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= n <= 10^9
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Generate the reverse of the binary string
 *   and use two pointers from the ends to determine
 *   where flips are needed.
