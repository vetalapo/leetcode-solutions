/**
 * 2432
 * The Employee That Worked on the Longest Task
 **
 * There are n employees,
 * each with a unique id from 0 to n - 1.
 *
 * You are given a 2D integer array logs
 * where logs[i] = [id^i, leaveTime^i] where:
 *   • idi is the id of the employee that worked on the ith task, and
 *   • leaveTime^i is the time at which the employee finished the ith task.
 *     All the values leaveTime^i are unique.
 *
 * Note that the ith task starts the moment right after the (i - 1)th task ends,
 * and the 0th task starts at time 0.
 *
 * Return the id of the employee
 * that worked the task with the longest time.
 * If there is a tie between two or more employees,
 * return the smallest id among them.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input:
 *     n = 10,
 *     logs = [[0,3],[2,5],[0,9],[1,15]]
 *   Output: 1
 *   Explanation:
 *     - Task 0 started at 0 and ended at 3 with 3 units of times.
 *     - Task 1 started at 3 and ended at 5 with 2 units of times.
 *     - Task 2 started at 5 and ended at 9 with 4 units of times.
 *     - Task 3 started at 9 and ended at 15 with 6 units of times.
 *     The task with the longest time is task 3 and the employee with id 1
 *     is the one that worked on it, so we return 1.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input:
 *     n = 26,
 *     logs = [[1,1],[3,7],[2,12],[7,17]]
 *   Output: 3
 *   Explanation:
 *     - Task 0 started at 0 and ended at 1 with 1 unit of times.
 *     - Task 1 started at 1 and ended at 7 with 6 units of times.
 *     - Task 2 started at 7 and ended at 12 with 5 units of times.
 *     - Task 3 started at 12 and ended at 17 with 5 units of times.
 *     The tasks with the longest time is task 1.
 *     The employee that worked on it is 3, so we return 3.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: n = 2, logs = [[0,10],[1,20]]
 *   Output: 0
 *   Explanation:
 *     - Task 0 started at 0 and ended at 10 with 10 units of times.
 *     - Task 1 started at 10 and ended at 20 with 10 units of times.
 *     The tasks with the longest time are tasks 0 and 1.
 *     The employees that worked on them are 0 and 1,
 *     so we return the smallest id 0.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 2 <= n <= 500
 *   • 1 <= logs.length <= 500
 *   • logs[i].length == 2
 *   • 0 <= id^i <= n - 1
 *   • 1 <= leaveTime^i <= 500
 *   • idi != id^i+1
 *   • leaveTimei are sorted in a strictly increasing order.
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Find the time of the longest task
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Store each employee’s longest task time in a hash table
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   For employees that have the same longest task time,
 *   we only need the employee with the smallest ID
