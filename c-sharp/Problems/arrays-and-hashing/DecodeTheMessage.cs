 * Decode the Message
 **
 * You are given the strings key and message,
 * which represent a cipher key and a secret message, respectively.
 *
 * The steps to decode message are as follows:
 *   1. Use the first appearance of all 26 lowercase English letters
 *      in key as the order of the substitution table.
 *   2. Align the substitution table with the regular English alphabet.
 *   3. Each letter in message is then substituted using the table.
 *   4. Spaces ' ' are transformed to themselves.
 *
 * For example,
 * given key = "happy boy"
 * (actual key would have at least one instance of each letter in the alphabet),
 * we have the partial substitution table of
 * ('h' -> 'a', 'a' -> 'b', 'p' -> 'c', 'y' -> 'd', 'b' -> 'e', 'o' -> 'f').
 * Return the decoded message.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: key = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", message = "vkbs bs t suepuv"
 *   Output: "this is a secret"
 *   Explanation:
 *     The diagram above shows the substitution table.
 *     It is obtained by taking the first appearance of each letter
 *     in "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: key = "eljuxhpwnyrdgtqkviszcfmabo", message = "zwx hnfx lqantp mnoeius ycgk vcnjrdb"
 *   Output: "the five boxing wizards jump quickly"
 *   Explanation:
 *     The diagram above shows the substitution table.
 *     It is obtained by taking the first appearance of each letter in "eljuxhpwnyrdgtqkviszcfmabo".
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 26 <= key.length <= 2000
 *   • key consists of lowercase English letters and ' '.
 *   • key contains every letter in the English alphabet ('a' to 'z') at least once.
 *   • 1 <= message.length <= 2000
 *   • message consists of lowercase English letters and ' '.
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Iterate through the characters in the key to construct a mapping to the English alphabet.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Make sure to check that the current character is not already in the mapping (only the first appearance is considered).
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   Map the characters in the message according to the constructed mapping.
