/**
 * 2515
 * Shortest Distance to Target String in a Circular Array
 **
 * You are given a 0-indexed circular string array words and a string target.
 * A circular array means that the array's end connects to the array's beginning.
 *
 * • Formally, the next element of words[i] is words[(i + 1) % n]
 *   and the previous element of words[i] is words[(i - 1 + n) % n],
 *   where n is the length of words.
 *
 * Starting from startIndex,
 * you can move to either the next word
 * or the previous word with 1 step at a time.
 *
 * Return the shortest distance needed to reach the string target.
 * If the string target does not exist in words, return -1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input:
 *     words = ["hello","i","am","leetcode","hello"], target = "hello", startIndex = 1
 *   Output: 1
 *   Explanation:
 *     We start from index 1 and can reach "hello" by
 *       - moving 3 units to the right to reach index 4.
 *       - moving 2 units to the left to reach index 4.
 *       - moving 4 units to the right to reach index 0.
 *       - moving 1 unit to the left to reach index 0.
 *     The shortest distance to reach "hello" is 1.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input:
 *     words = ["a","b","leetcode"], target = "leetcode", startIndex = 0
 *   Output: 1
 *   Explanation:
 *     We start from index 0 and can reach "leetcode" by
 *       - moving 2 units to the right to reach index 2.
 *       - moving 1 unit to the left to reach index 2.
 *     The shortest distance to reach "leetcode" is 1.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input:
 *     words = ["i","eat","leetcode"], target = "ate", startIndex = 0
 *   Output: -1
 *   Explanation:
 *     Since "ate" does not exist in words, we return -1.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= words.length <= 100
 *   • 1 <= words[i].length <= 100
 *   • words[i] and target consist of only lowercase English letters.
 *   • 0 <= startIndex < words.length
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   You have two options,
 *   either move straight to the left or move straight to the right.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Find the first target word and record the distance.
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   Choose the one with the minimum distance.
