 * Find Most Frequent Vowel and Consonant
 **
 * You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z').
 *
 * Your task is to:
 *   • Find the vowel (one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u') with the maximum frequency.
 *   • Find the consonant (all other letters excluding vowels) with the maximum frequency.
 *
 * Return the sum of the two frequencies.
 *
 * Note:
 *   If multiple vowels or consonants have the same maximum frequency,
 *   you may choose any one of them.
 *   If there are no vowels or no consonants in the string,
 *   consider their frequency as 0.
 *
 * The frequency of a letter x is the number of times it occurs in the string.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: s = "successes"
 *   Output: 6
 *   Explanation:
 *     The vowels are: 'u' (frequency 1), 'e' (frequency 2).
 *     The maximum frequency is 2.
 *     The consonants are: 's' (frequency 4), 'c' (frequency 2).
 *     The maximum frequency is 4.
 *     The output is 2 + 4 = 6.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: s = "aeiaeia"
 *   Output: 3
 *   Explanation:
 *     The vowels are: 'a' (frequency 3), 'e' ( frequency 2), 'i' (frequency 2).
 *     The maximum frequency is 3.
 *     There are no consonants in s.
 *     Hence, maximum consonant frequency = 0.
 *     The output is 3 + 0 = 3.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= s.length <= 100
 *   • s consists of lowercase English letters only.
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Use a hashmap
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Simulate as described
