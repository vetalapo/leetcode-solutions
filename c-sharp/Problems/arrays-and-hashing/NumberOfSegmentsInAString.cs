 * Number of Segments in a String
 **
 * Given a string s,
 * return the number of segments in the string.
 * A segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: s = "Hello, my name is John"
 *   Output: 5
 *   Explanation:
 *     The five segments are ["Hello,", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: s = "Hello"
 *   Output: 1
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 0 <= s.length <= 300
 *   • s consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters, digits,
 *     or one of the following characters "!@#$%^&*()_+-=',.:".
 *   • The only space character in s is ' '.
