 * Determine the Winner of a Bowling Game
 **
 * You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays player1 and player2,
 * representing the number of pins
 * that player 1 and player 2 hit in a bowling game, respectively.
 *
 * The bowling game consists of n turns,
 * and the number of pins in each turn is exactly 10.
 *
 * Assume a player hits xi pins in the ith turn.
 * The value of the ith turn for the player is:
 *   • 2xi if the player hits 10 pins in either (i - 1)th or (i - 2)th turn.
 *   • Otherwise, it is xi.
 *
 * The score of the player is the sum of the values of their n turns.
 *
 * Return
 *   • 1 if the score of player 1 is more than the score of player 2,
 *   • 2 if the score of player 2 is more than the score of player 1, and
 *   • 0 in case of a draw.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: player1 = [5,10,3,2], player2 = [6,5,7,3]
 *   Output: 1
 *   Explanation:
 *     The score of player 1 is 5 + 10 + 2*3 + 2*2 = 25.
 *     The score of player 2 is 6 + 5 + 7 + 3 = 21.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: player1 = [3,5,7,6], player2 = [8,10,10,2]
 *   Output: 2
 *   Explanation:
 *     The score of player 1 is 3 + 5 + 7 + 6 = 21.
 *     The score of player 2 is 8 + 10 + 2*10 + 2*2 = 42.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: player1 = [2,3], player2 = [4,1]
 *   Output: 0
 *   Explanation:
 *     The score of player1 is 2 + 3 = 5.
 *     The score of player2 is 4 + 1 = 5.
 *
 * Example 4:
 *   Input: player1 = [1,1,1,10,10,10,10], player2 = [10,10,10,10,1,1,1]
 *   Output: 2
 *   Explanation:
 *     The score of player1 is 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 2*10 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 73.
 *     The score of player2 is 10 + 2*10 + 2*10 + 2*10 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 1 = 75.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • n == player1.length == player2.length
 *   • 1 <= n <= 1000
 *   • 0 <= player1[i], player2[i] <= 10
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Think about simulating the process to calculate the answer.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Iterate over each element and check the previous two elements.
 *   See if one of them is 10 and can affect the score.
