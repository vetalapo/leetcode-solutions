 * Capitalize the Title
 **
 * You are given a string title
 * consisting of one or more words separated by a single space,
 * where each word consists of English letters.
 * Capitalize the string by changing the capitalization of each word such that:
 *   • If the length of the word is 1 or 2 letters, change all letters to lowercase.
 *   • Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.
 *
 * Return the capitalized title.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: title = "capiTalIze tHe titLe"
 *   Output: "Capitalize The Title"
 *   Explanation:
 *     Since all the words have a length of at least 3,
 *     the first letter of each word is uppercase,
 *     and the remaining letters are lowercase.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: title = "First leTTeR of EACH Word"
 *   Output: "First Letter of Each Word"
 *   Explanation:
 *     The word "of" has length 2, so it is all lowercase.
 *     The remaining words have a length of at least 3,
 *     so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase,
 *     and the remaining letters are lowercase.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: title = "i lOve leetcode"
 *   Output: "i Love Leetcode"
 *   Explanation:
 *     The word "i" has length 1, so it is lowercase.
 *     The remaining words have a length of at least 3,
 *     so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase,
 *     and the remaining letters are lowercase.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= title.length <= 100
 *   • title consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
 *   • Each word consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and is non-empty.
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Firstly, try to find all the words present in the string.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   On the basis of each word's lengths,
 *   simulate the process explained in Problem.
