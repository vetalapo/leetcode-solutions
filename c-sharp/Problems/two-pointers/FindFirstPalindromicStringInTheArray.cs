 * Find First Palindromic String in the Array
 **
 * Given an array of strings words,
 * return the first palindromic string in the array.
 * If there is no such string, return an empty string "".
 *
 * A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
 *   Output: "ada"
 *   Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
 *   Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
 *   Output: "racecar"
 *   Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
 *   Output: ""
 *   Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= words.length <= 100
 *   • 1 <= words[i].length <= 100
 *   • words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Iterate through the elements in order.
 *   As soon as the current element is a palindrome, return it.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   To check if an element is a palindrome,
 *   can you reverse the string?
