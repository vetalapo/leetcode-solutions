 * Check Divisibility by Digit Sum and Product
 **
 * You are given a positive integer n.
 * Determine whether n is divisible
 * by the sum of the following two values:
 *   • The digit sum of n (the sum of its digits).
 *   • The digit product of n (the product of its digits).
 *
 * Return true if n is divisible by this sum; otherwise, return false.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: n = 99
 *   Output: true
 *   Explanation:
 *     Since 99 is divisible by the sum (9 + 9 = 18)
 *     plus product (9 * 9 = 81) of its digits (total 99),
 *     the output is true.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: n = 23
 *   Output: false
 *   Explanation:
 *     Since 23 is not divisible by the sum (2 + 3 = 5)
 *     plus product (2 * 3 = 6) of its digits (total 11),
 *     the output is false.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= n <= 10^6
