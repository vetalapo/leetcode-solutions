 * Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range
 **
 * Given two non-negative integers low and high.
 * Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: low = 3, high = 7
 *   Output: 3
 *   Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: low = 8, high = 10
 *   Output: 1
 *   Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 0 <= low <= high <= 10^9
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   If the range (high - low + 1) is even,
 *   the number of even and odd numbers in this range will be the same.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   If the range (high - low + 1) is odd,
 *   the solution will depend on the parity of high and low.
