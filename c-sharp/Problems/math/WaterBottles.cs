 * 1518
 * Water Bottles
 **
 * There are numBottles water bottles
 * that are initially full of water.
 * You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles
 * from the market with one full water bottle.
 *
 * The operation of drinking a full water bottle
 * turns it into an empty bottle.
 *
 * Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange,
 * return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
 *   Output: 13
 *   Explanation:
 *     You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
 *     Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
 *   Output: 19
 *   Explanation:
 *     You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
 *     Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= numBottles <= 100
 *   • 2 <= numExchange <= 100
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Simulate the process until
 *   there are not enough empty bottles
 *   for even one full bottle of water.
