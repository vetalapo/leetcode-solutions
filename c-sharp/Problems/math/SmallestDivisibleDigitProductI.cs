 * 3345
 * Smallest Divisible Digit Product I
 **
 * You are given two integers n and t.
 * Return the smallest number greater than or equal to n
 * such that the product of its digits is divisible by t.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: n = 10, t = 2
 *   Output: 10
 *   Explanation:
 *     The digit product of 10 is 0,
 *     which is divisible by 2,
 *     making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 10
 *     that satisfies the condition.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: n = 15, t = 3
 *   Output: 16
 *   Explanation:
 *     The digit product of 16 is 6,
 *     which is divisible by 3,
 *     making it the smallest number greater than or equal to 15
 *     that satisfies the condition.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= n <= 100
 *   • 1 <= t <= 10
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   You have to check at most 10 numbers.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Apply a brute-force approach by checking each possible number.
