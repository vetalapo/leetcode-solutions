 * Find the K-th Character in String Game I
 **
 * Alice and Bob are playing a game.
 * Initially,
 * Alice has a string word = "a".
 *
 * You are given a positive integer k.
 *
 * Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation forever:
 *   • Generate a new string
 *     by changing each character in word
 *     to its next character in the English alphabet,
 *     and append it to the original word.
 *
 * For example,
 * performing the operation on "c" generates "cd"
 * and performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".
 *
 * Return the value of the kth character in word,
 * after enough operations have been done for word
 * to have at least k characters.
 *
 * Note that the character 'z' can be changed to 'a' in the operation.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: k = 5
 *   Output: "b"
 *   Explanation:
 *     Initially, word = "a". We need to do the operation three times:
 *     Generated string is "b", word becomes "ab".
 *     Generated string is "bc", word becomes "abbc".
 *     Generated string is "bccd", word becomes "abbcbccd".
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: k = 10
 *   Output: "c"
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= k <= 500
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   The constraints are small.
 *   Construct the string by simulating the operations.
