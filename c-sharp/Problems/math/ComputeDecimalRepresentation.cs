 * Compute Decimal Representation
 **
 * You are given a positive integer n.
 *
 * A positive integer is a base-10 component
 * if it is the product of a single digit from 1 to 9
 * and a non-negative power of 10.
 * For example,
 * 500, 30, and 7 are base-10 components, while 537, 102, and 11 are not.
 *
 * Express n as a sum of only base-10 components,
 * using the fewest base-10 components possible.
 *
 * Return an array containing these base-10 components in descending order.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: n = 537
 *   Output: [500,30,7]
 *   Explanation:
 *     We can express 537 as 500 + 30 + 7.
 *     It is impossible to express 537
 *     as a sum using fewer than 3 base-10 components.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: n = 102
 *   Output: [100,2]
 *   Explanation:
 *     We can express 102 as 100 + 2.
 *     102 is not a base-10 component,
 *     which means 2 base-10 components are needed.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: n = 6
 *   Output: [6]
 *   Explanation:
 *     6 is a base-10 component.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= n <= 10^9
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Break the number down digit by digit starting from the ones place.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Each nonzero digit contributes a base-10 component.
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   Collect all components and return them in descending order.
