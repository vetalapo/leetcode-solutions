 * Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array
 **
 * Given an integer array nums,
 * return the greatest common divisor of the smallest number
 * and largest number in nums.
 *
 * The greatest common divisor of two numbers
 * is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10]
 *   Output: 2
 *   Explanation:
 *     The smallest number in nums is 2.
 *     The largest number in nums is 10.
 *     The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3]
 *   Output: 1
 *   Explanation:
 *     The smallest number in nums is 3.
 *     The largest number in nums is 8.
 *     The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: nums = [3,3]
 *   Output: 3
 *   Explanation:
 *     The smallest number in nums is 3.
 *     The largest number in nums is 3.
 *     The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 2 <= nums.length <= 1000
 *   • 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Find the minimum and maximum in one iteration.
 *   Let them be mn and mx.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Try all the numbers in the range [1, mn]
 *   and check the largest number which divides both of them.
