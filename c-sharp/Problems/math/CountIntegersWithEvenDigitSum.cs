 * Count Integers With Even Digit Sum
 **
 * Given a positive integer num,
 * return the number of positive integers less than or equal to num
 * whose digit sums are even.
 *
 * The digit sum of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: num = 4
 *   Output: 2
 *   Explanation:
 *     The only integers less than or equal to 4
 *     whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: num = 30
 *   Output: 14
 *   Explanation:
 *     The 14 integers less than or equal to 30
 *     whose digit sums are even are
 *     2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= num <= 1000
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Iterate through all integers from 1 to num.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   For any integer,
 *   extract the individual digits to compute their sum and check if it is even.
