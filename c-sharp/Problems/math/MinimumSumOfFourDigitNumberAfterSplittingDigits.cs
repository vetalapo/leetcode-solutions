 * 2160
 * Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits
 **
 * You are given a positive integer num consisting of exactly four digits.
 * Split num into two new integers new1 and new2
 * by using the digits found in num.
 * Leading zeros are allowed in new1 and new2,
 * and all the digits found in num must be used.
 *
 * For example,
 * given num = 2932,
 * you have the following digits:
 * two 2's, one 9 and one 3.
 * Some of the possible pairs [new1, new2]
 * are [22, 93], [23, 92], [223, 9] and [2, 329].
 *
 * Return the minimum possible sum of new1 and new2.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: num = 2932
 *   Output: 52
 *   Explanation:
 *     Some possible pairs [new1, new2] are [29, 23], [223, 9], etc.
 *     The minimum sum can be obtained by the pair [29, 23]: 29 + 23 = 52.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: num = 4009
 *   Output: 13
 *   Explanation:
 *     Some possible pairs [new1, new2] are [0, 49], [490, 0], etc.
 *     The minimum sum can be obtained by the pair [4, 9]: 4 + 9 = 13.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1000 <= num <= 9999
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Notice that the most optimal way to obtain the minimum possible sum
 *   using 4 digits is by summing up two 2-digit numbers.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   We can use the two smallest digits out of the four
 *   as the digits found in the tens place respectively.
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   Similarly,
 *   we use the final 2 larger digits
 *   as the digits found in the ones place.
