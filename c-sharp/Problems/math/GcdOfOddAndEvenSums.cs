 * GCD of Odd and Even Sums
 **
 * You are given an integer n.
 * Your task is to compute the GCD (greatest common divisor)
 * of two values:
 *   • sumOdd: the sum of the first n odd numbers.
 *   • sumEven: the sum of the first n even numbers.
 *
 * Return the GCD of sumOdd and sumEven.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: n = 4
 *   Output: 4
 *   Explanation:
 *     • Sum of the first 4 odd numbers sumOdd = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
 *     • Sum of the first 4 even numbers sumEven = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20
 *     Hence, GCD(sumOdd, sumEven) = GCD(16, 20) = 4.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: n = 5
 *   Output: 5
 *   Explanation:
 *     • Sum of the first 5 odd numbers sumOdd = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25
 *     • Sum of the first 5 even numbers sumEven = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30
 *     Hence, GCD(sumOdd, sumEven) = GCD(25, 30) = 5.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= n <= 10​​​​​​​00
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   The first n odd numbers sum to n * n
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   First n even numbers sum to n * (n + 1)
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   gcd(n, n + 1) = 1, so the answer is n
