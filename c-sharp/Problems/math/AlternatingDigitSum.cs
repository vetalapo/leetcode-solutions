 * Alternating Digit Sum
 **
 * You are given a positive integer n.
 * Each digit of n has a sign according to the following rules:
 *   • The most significant digit is assigned a positive sign.
 *   • Each other digit has an opposite sign to its adjacent digits.
 *
 * Return the sum of all digits with their corresponding sign.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: n = 521
 *   Output: 4
 *   Explanation: (+5) + (-2) + (+1) = 4.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: n = 111
 *   Output: 1
 *   Explanation: (+1) + (-1) + (+1) = 1.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: n = 886996
 *   Output: 0
 *   Explanation: (+8) + (-8) + (+6) + (-9) + (+9) + (-6) = 0.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= n <= 10^9
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   The first step is to loop over the digits.
 *   We can convert the integer into a string,
 *   an array of digits, or just loop over its digits.
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   Keep a variable sign that initially equals 1
 *   and a variable answer that initially equals 0.
 *
 * Hint 3:
 *   Each time you loop over a digit i,
 *   add sign * i to answer,
 *   then multiply sign by -1.
