 * 222
 * Count Complete Tree Nodes
 **
 * Given the root of a complete binary tree,
 * return the number of the nodes in the tree.
 *
 * According to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees),
 * every level, except possibly the last,
 * is completely filled in a complete binary tree,
 * and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
 * It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
 *
 * Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 *   Output: 6
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: root = []
 *   Output: 0
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: root = [1]
 *   Output: 1
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
 *   • 0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10^4
 *   • The tree is guaranteed to be complete.
