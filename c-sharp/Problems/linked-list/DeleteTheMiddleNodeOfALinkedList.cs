 * Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List
 **
 * You are given the head of a linked list.
 * Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.
 *
 * The middle node of a linked list of size n
 * is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing,
 * where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.
 *
 *  • For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,
 *    the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
 *   Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
 *   Explanation:
 *     The above figure represents the given linked list.
 *     The indices of the nodes are written below.
 *     Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
 *     We return the new list after removing this node. 
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
 *   Output: [1,2,4]
 *   Explanation:
 *     The above figure represents the given linked list.
 *     For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: head = [2,1]
 *   Output: [2]
 *   Explanation:
 *     The above figure represents the given linked list.
 *     For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
 *     Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10^5].
 *   • 1 <= Node.val <= 10^5
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   If a point with a speed s moves n units in a given time,
 *   a point with speed 2 * s will move 2 * n units at the same time.
 *   Can you use this to find the middle node of a linked list?
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   If you are given the middle node,
 *   the node before it, and the node after it,
 *   how can you modify the linked list?
