 * 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
 **
 * We have two special characters:
 *   • The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
 *   • The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
 *
 * Given a binary array bits that ends with 0,
 * return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: bits = [1,0,0]
 *   Output: true
 *   Explanation:
 *     The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
 *     So the last character is one-bit character.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
 *   Output: false
 *   Explanation:
 *     The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
 *     So the last character is not one-bit character.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= bits.length <= 1000
 *   • bits[i] is either 0 or 1.
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   Keep track of where the next character starts.
 *   At the end, you want to know if you started on the last bit.
