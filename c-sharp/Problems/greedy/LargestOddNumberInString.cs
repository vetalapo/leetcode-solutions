 * Largest Odd Number in String
 **
 * You are given a string num, representing a large integer.
 * Return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string)
 * that is a non-empty substring of num,
 * or an empty string "" if no odd integer exists.
 *
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *   Input: num = "52"
 *   Output: "5"
 *   Explanation:
 *     The only non-empty substrings are "5", "2", and "52".
 *     "5" is the only odd number.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *   Input: num = "4206"
 *   Output: ""
 *   Explanation: There are no odd numbers in "4206".
 *
 * Example 3:
 *   Input: num = "35427"
 *   Output: "35427"
 *   Explanation: "35427" is already an odd number.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   • 1 <= num.length <= 10^5
 *   • num only consists of digits and does not contain any leading zeros.
 *
 * Hint 1:
 *   In what order should you iterate through the digits?
 *
 * Hint 2:
 *   If an odd number exists, where must the number start from?
